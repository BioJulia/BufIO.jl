    BufWriter(io::IO, [buffer_size::Int])::BufWriter

Wrap an `IO` in a struct with a new buffer, giving it the `AbstractBufWriter` interface.

The `BufWriter` has an infinitely growable buffer, and will only expand the buffer if `grow_buffer`
is called on it while it does not contain any data (as shown by `get_unflushed`).

Throw an `ArgumentError` if `buffer_size` is < 1.

    get_buffer(io::AbstractBufWriter)::MutableMemoryView{UInt8}

Get the available mutable buffer of `io` that can be written to.

should not attempt to flush data from the buffer or grow the buffer.
To increase the size of the buffer, call [`grow_buffer`](@ref).

"""
    get_unflushed(io::AbstractBufWriter)::MutableMemoryView{UInt8}

Return a view into the buffered data already written to `io` and `consume`d,
but not yet flushed to its underlying IO.

Bytes not appearing in the buffer may not be completely flushed
if there are more layers of buffering in the IO wrapped by `io`. However, any bytes
already consumed and not returned in `get_unflushed` should not be buffered in `io` itself.

Mutating the returned buffer is allowed, and should not cause `io` to malfunction.
After mutating the returned buffer and calling `flush`, values in the updated buffer
will be flushed.

This function has no default implementation and methods are optionally added to subtypes
of `AbstractBufWriter` that can fullfil the above restrictions.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer(); writer = BufWriter(io);

julia> isempty(get_unflushed(writer))

"""
    grow_buffer(io::AbstractBufWriter)::Int

Increase the amount of bytes in the writeable buffer of `io` if possible, returning
the number of bytes added. After calling `grow_buffer` and getting `n`,
the buffer obtained by `get_buffer` should have `n` more bytes.

The buffer is usually grown by flushing the buffer, expanding or reallocating the buffer.
If none of these can grow the buffer, return zero.

!!! note
    Idiomatically, users should not call `grow_buffer` when the buffer is not empty,
    because doing so forces growing the buffer instead of letting `io` choose an optimal
    buffer size. Calling `grow_buffer` with a nonempty buffer is only appropriate if, for
    algorithmic reasons you need `io` buffer to be able to hold some minimum amount of data
    before flushing.

The filesize  is computed *after* the flush.
Seeking outside these bounds throws an `IOError` of kind `BadSeek`.
Seeking should only change the filesize through its flush, so seeking an already-flushed
stream should not change the filesize.

If seeking to before the current position (as defined by `position`), data between
the new and the previous position need not be changed, and the underlying file or IO
need not immediately be truncated. However, new write operations should write (or
overwrite) data at the new position.

This method is not generically defined for `AbstractBufWriter`. Implementors of `seek`

`devnull` may have a filesize of zero, even if many bytes was flushed to it.)
